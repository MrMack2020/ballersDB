# BallersDB

## This is a *backend Flask build* that intends to do the following:

-create a database of quality footballers from the 80's onwards

-users will have to **register**, **login**, **create players**, **add players**, **update player information** and **delete players**

-**'players'** are saved by *surname (alphabetically)*, *nationality*, *clubs played for*, *cups won*, *leagues won*, *international tournaments won*

-then stored within **'nations'** that they were born in.
